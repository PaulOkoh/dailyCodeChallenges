Convert number to reversed array of digits
Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.

Example:
348597 => [7,9,5,8,4,3]
0 => [0]

solution
function digitize(n) {
  return String(n).split("").reverse().map((n)=> {
    return Number(n)
  })
}

Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

For example:

Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

solution
class SmallestIntegerFinder {
  findSmallestInt(args) {
    return Math.min(...args)
  }
}

Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T').

Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').

Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.

For example:

"GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"
The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty. All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever consist of 'G', 'C', 'A' and/or 'T'.

Solution(by codewars)
function DNAtoRNA(dna) {
  return dna.split('T').join('U')
}
